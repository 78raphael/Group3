// Core Requirements

//  01
//  Build a 3X3 board in HTML and CSS.
//  You could do this with either a table element, or a collection of divs. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.

//  02
//  Attach a touchend listener to the board.
//  When a cell is touched it should add either an 'X or an 'O', depending on whether it is player 1 or player 2's turn.

// 03
// Add a reset button.
// When touched the reset button should remove all of the marks from the board.




// Stretch Goals

// 01
// Borders all around the outside, incorrect
// Onlt borders on the inside, correct
// Hint: look into :nth-child(n), :last-child, etc for help to target specific cells to turn borders on or off.


// 02
// Add Game logic
// Right now the players have to decide who won, or whether it was a tie. Add some game logic to figure out when the game should result in a tie.



// 03
// Add More Game logic
// Add the logic to figure out when someone wins.
